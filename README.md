This was the first project that i build using the selenium extension to automate proccess, i had used the extension 'Pyautogui' before, but itÂ´s not a good practice simule one click, also that, the selenium can offer to us another benefits that the pyautogui don't oofer to us, like ; 
<ul>
  <li>We can run this application in second place, this is, i can do another things on my computer while the script is running, the code will not be affected with this</li>
  <li>I put this code on AWS server, so making this way, the code will run in one server and will continue sending me emails about the variations of the coins</li>
  <li>If i want, i can become this application one executable file, with this, i can run this code in one machine that have no python installed for example</li>
</ul>
